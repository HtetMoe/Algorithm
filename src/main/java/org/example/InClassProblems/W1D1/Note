P  = polynomial time
    - P is a class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
    - eg. Sorting, Finding GCD.

NP = Nondeterministic Polynomial time
    - a solution can be verified in polynomial time.
    - In short, problems in NP are easy to verify but not necessarily easy to solve.
    - eg. Subset Sum Problem

EXP = exponential time
    - EXP is a class of problems that require exponential time to solve,
      meaning the time to solve them grows exponentially with the input size,
      like O(2^n), O(3^n)
      eg. Subset sum, n * n chess

EXP-complete problems are the hardest problems in class EXP. They meet two conditions:
    - Belong to EXP: They require exponential time to solve.
    - Never in P: There’s no polynomial-time solution, meaning they will never be efficiently solvable.
    - eg. n×n Chess.

Halting problem
    - a problem that cannot be solved by any algorithm
    - undecidable problem
