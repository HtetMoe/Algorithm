Pattern 1. Three pointers
Read Lesson 1.

Q1. What is common to all three algorithms?
    	•	Deterministic: Each algorithm consistently produces the same output for the same input.
    	•	Iterative or Recursive: All can be implemented using either approach.
    	•	Efficiency: Each is designed to minimize time and space complexity.

Q2. What are their time complexities?
        1.	GCD (Euclidean Algorithm): O(log(min(a, b)))
    	2.	Nth Fibonacci Number: O(n)
    	3.	Reversing a Singly Linked List: O(n)


 (Halting Problem) Given a Java program R (having a main method), when R is
 executed, does R terminate normally? (No runtime exceptions, no infinite
 loops.)
 => There is no algorithm that can solve this problem for every possible Java program R.
