- practice W1D6 as well

- reducing a problem into sub-problems

Sorting
---------
1. selection sort : O(n^2)
2. bubble sort    : O(n^2)
3. insertion sort : O(n^2)

4. Merge Sort     : O(n log n)

Order --> 1 <= n <= log(n) <= nlog(n) <= n^2

Apply Master Theorem
-----------------------
    a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = n
    calculate n^ (log a based b) = n
    f(n) == n^ (log a based b)
    if equal => case 2, Time complexity : O(n log n)
