Dynamic Programming : (defined by recurrences with overlapping sub-problems)
    - is a technique for solving problems with overlapping sub-problems by
      storing solutions to avoid repeated calculations.

Overlapping sub problems :
    - DP solves each subproblem only once and stores the result for future
      use (memoization).
