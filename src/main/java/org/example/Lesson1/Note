Pattern 1. Three pointers
Read Lesson 1.

Google and write down:
       1. an iterative algorithm to compute gcd.
       2. an iterative algorithm to compute the n-th Fibonacci number.
       3. an an iterative algorithm to reverse a singly linked list.
Study and practice all three algorithms.

Q1. What is common to all three algorithms?
    	•	Deterministic: Each algorithm consistently produces the same output for the same input.
    	•	Iterative or Recursive: All can be implemented using either approach.
    	•	Efficiency: Each is designed to minimize time and space complexity.

Q2. What are their time complexities?
        1.	GCD (Euclidean Algorithm): O(log(min(a, b)))
    	2.	Nth Fibonacci Number: O(n)
    	3.	Reversing a Singly Linked List: O(n)
