DSA?
=> Data Structure : the way to store and organize data.
=> Algorithm : step by step procedure to solve a specific problem

What's big O?
    => tool to describe time/space complexity of algorithms
    (is a powerful tool used in computer science to describe the time/space complexity of algorithms.)

What's space complexity?
    => total space taken by the algorithm.
    => includes both auxiliary space(temporary space used by algorithm) and space used by input.

    1.	Worst-case (Big-O): O(n)
    2.	Best-case (Big-Omega, Ω): Ω(n)
    3.	Average-case (Theta, Θ): Θ(n)
